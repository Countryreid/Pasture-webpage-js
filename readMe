# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This was designed to be the beginning of a pasture calculator. By inputing information about your pasture the calculator would determine the number of days the horses could stay on pasture and still leave adequate grass to regrow quickly. 

The purpose was to serve as a beginning trial to an app that i want to create and help me learn Javascript. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
